The main three files that work together for implementing the Stumpf et al. (2003) algorithm are SDB_Functions.py, linear_regression.py, and main.py. Main.py is what called functions from both SDB_Functions and linear_regression. 

Switching.py is a separate implementation of the Caballero et al. (2020) red/green SDB swtiching method.
